Spectre and Meltdown are security vulnerabilities discovered in modern CPUs that exploit the speculative execution feature, 
which is used to enhance performance by executing instructions before it is certain they will be needed.

Spectre
Overview: Spectre affects a wide range of processors, including those from Intel, AMD, and ARM. 
          It allows attackers to trick a processor into executing instructions that should not have been run, 
          leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
Mechanism: By exploiting speculative execution, attackers can create side-channel attacks that manipulate the CPUâ€™s cache. 
           For example, an attacker could cause the CPU to execute code that accesses sensitive memory locations, 
           and then measure the time it takes to access data to infer information about it.
Impact: Spectre can potentially expose sensitive data across process boundaries, making it a severe threat to data integrity and privacy. 
        It is particularly concerning for cloud computing environments where multiple tenants share the same hardware.

        
Meltdown
Overview: Meltdown primarily affects Intel processors, although some ARM and AMD chips are also vulnerable under certain conditions. 
          It allows unauthorized access to memory that is normally protected by the operating system.
Mechanism: Meltdown breaks the isolation between user applications and the operating system. 
           It does this by exploiting the way CPUs perform out-of-order execution. An attacker can run code that bypasses memory protections and reads privileged memory.
Impact: Meltdown enables an attacker to read sensitive data, such as passwords and encryption keys, from the memory of other processes, 
        including the kernel. This can lead to significant security breaches, especially in multi-user environments.
